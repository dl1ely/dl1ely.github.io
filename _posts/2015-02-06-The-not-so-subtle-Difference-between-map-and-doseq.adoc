= The (not so) subtle Difference between map and doseq

Recently, i did some easy reporting over CSV data using Clojure, and
for that i had to separate the lines and look up duplicate IDs by adding
new IDs to one `atom` and adding already seen ones to another `atom`.
At the end i wanted to print the contents of the `atom` of duplicates.

I read the CSV data using https://github.com/davidsantiago/clojure-csv[`clojure-csv`] which gives me a vector of vectors
with the data of each line. Now i wanted to process each line separately.

Without much thinking, i used `map` to feed a function that worked on a single
line. The code looked like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns duplicates.core
  (:gen-class))

(require '[clojure-csv.core :as csv])

(def seen-ids (atom #{}))
(def duplicate-ids (atom #{}))

(defn update-ids [v]
 (let [id (nth v 1)]
    (if (contains? @seen-ids rid) (swap! duplicate-ids conj id))
    (swap! seen-ids conj id)))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (let [rawdata (slurp args)
        parseddata (rest (csv/parse-csv rawdata :delimiter \;))]
    (map update-ids parseddata))
  (println @duplicate-ids))
----

Unexpectedly, after applying `map`, my `atom` of duplicates was empty, although i knew there were duplicates.

After some thinking, i realized my function had not been called at all.
This is incredibly obvious when reading only the first few words of the `map` https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map[function doc string]:

    Returns a lazy sequenceâ€¦

A *lazy* sequence only gets evaluated when needed, that is when elements of the mapped collection are asked for. In my case that was not the case, the sequence `map` did create was discarded, as i was only interested in the *side-effect* of updating the `atom` `duplicate-ids`.

This is surely a beginners mistake, but still it took me a minute to realize that. Now, a solution was easy: Instead of using `map`, let's use https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq[`doseq`] that calls the function in turn, executing all possible side effects und returning `nil`:

[source,clojure]
----
(doseq [v parseddata] (update-ids v))
----

And finally, i had the IDs of my duplicate data sets in my `atom`.
So always be sure not to step into that small trap of laziness.
